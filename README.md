# customer-segmentation-analysis
This project focuses on analyzing customer behavior and segmenting them based on their purchasing patterns from September 2020 to October 2021. The goal is to uncover insights and build a customer segmentation model to guide targeted communications and marketing strategies.

## Key Analysis Steps:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Investigated user activity, highlighting the share of active vs. inactive users across different regions. Analyzed trends in customer acquisition, retention, and potential seasonal variations in purchasing behavior.
Customer Segmentation (RFM Analysis):
- Applied the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) model to categorize customers based on their recency of purchase, frequency of purchases, and total spending. Normalized the data to account for geographical differences in spending behavior.

## Customer Segments Identified:
- Loyal Customers: Engaged, frequent buyers with high spending.
- High Potential (Lost Big Spenders): Customers with a history of high spending, but reduced recent activity.
- Recent but Low Value: New customers with low spending but potential for growth.
- At-Risk or Churned: Customers showing signs of inactivity and low engagement.

## Takeaways & Recommendations:
Tailored strategies for each segment were proposed to improve customer retention and re-engagement, focusing on targeted offers, promotions, and discounts.
The analysis provides a comprehensive view of customer behavior, offering actionable insights to boost customer loyalty and drive revenue.
